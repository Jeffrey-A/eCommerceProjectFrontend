## My contribution 
Developed this application in collaboration with Asifa Khan.  

### What I worked on:  
•  Managed the state of the entire application. In addition, I added state and interactivity to the stateless components created by Asifa.  
•  Implemented the shopping cart functionality.  
•  Implemented real payment handling using the Stripe API.  
•  Implemented user authentication.  
•  Wrote all the server side code. For instance, I created the end points, the data base, the data base tables, models, etc.    
•  Connected the front-end with the back-end.   
•  Deployed the front-end to Netlify and the back-end to Heroku.
